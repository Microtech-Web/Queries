1. SQL Basics

What SQL is (Structured Query Language).

Different types of SQL commands:

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP

DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT

DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT

2. Working with Tables

Creating tables (CREATE TABLE)

Modifying tables (ALTER TABLE)

Constraints:

PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY

UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, DEFAULT

3. Data Retrieval (Queries)

Basic SELECT statements

Filtering data with WHERE

Operators: =, !=, <, >, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN

Sorting with ORDER BY

Limiting results with LIMIT / TOP

4. Joins & Relationships

INNER JOIN

LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN

FULL OUTER JOIN

SELF JOIN

Understanding one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many relationships

5. Aggregations & Grouping

Aggregate functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

Grouping results: GROUP BY

Filtering groups: HAVING

6. Subqueries

Nested SELECT queries

IN, EXISTS, ANY, ALL with subqueries

7. Set Operations

UNION vs UNION ALL

INTERSECT

EXCEPT / MINUS

8. Indexes & Performance

Creating and using indexes (CREATE INDEX)

Understanding how indexes speed up queries

9. Transactions

BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

10. Views & Stored Procedures

Creating views (CREATE VIEW)

Stored procedures & functions (depends on SQL flavor)

Triggers

11. Advanced Topics (optional but useful)

Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LEAD, LAG)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) with WITH

Normalization & database design

Partitioning & sharding basics
